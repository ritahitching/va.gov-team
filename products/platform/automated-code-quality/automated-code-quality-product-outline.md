## User Goals (VSF Teams)
- Reduce the time spent waiting for PR reviews from the VSP team on changes to the front-end
- Understand what standardard set of quality measures that my code will measured against

## Business Goals
- Speed up the development cycle for VFS Teams by cutting down on PR reviews
- Reduce the amount of unnecessary manual code reviews performed by the VSP FE Team
- Automate the quality process so that the FE Team focus on manual code reviews for only the most important code changes to ensure there is not a negative impact to the platform
- Allow more autonomy to the VSF teams while providing the platform a method to set a standard quality bar and keep a pulse on VFS teams adherence.
